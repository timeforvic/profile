      <p>I currently go to NYC Museum School. The link is right below.<p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite things do aside from sleep is pkay video games such as fortnite. Sadly, my fortnite account got hacked so all my data got deleted. That means a lot of money wasted and new account starting new. Thats wack though, but now I can be Tfue :).</p>

        <p>However, I don't like to stay home and play all day a lot. One of ,my most favorite things is to play soccer. My idol in soccer is Lionel Messi, since he's the best currently. I know no one will ever be as good as him but IO try to practice as much as I can to be my best. My goal is to be a starter for my school varsity team by junior year. Right now I get close to no playing time but just a freshman. </p>

          <p>Another fun fact, is that I'm likely one of the best fifa players you know aside from pros. I.ve been playing that game since I was 6 but always have got beat by my brother. He's older than me and used to be beter than me in the game but not anymore. I rarely play as much but when i do play, i go off. But last year i started playing 2k. I'm alright at the game but definitely not bewtter than my cousin:(. But now I don't really play any game aside from Fortnite. But once, Anthem and the Division 2 came out, you won't catch me there.</p>
